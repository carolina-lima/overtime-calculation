# overtime-calculation

This script uses the datetime and datetimerange modules to count overtime using the start and end of a shift.

There are several improvements to increase this script, such as getting the scalation directly in the pagerduty api, decreasing the amount of "ifs", exporting to a .csv file...

This is a MVP
